<h2>Description</h2>
WORK IN PROGRESS TO UPDATE THIS DESCRIPTION
The description should help users understand the content of the tracks and reviews the concepts
or analysis represented. Often a publication abstract can provide a good description.

<p>
Example text: This track represents the <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/" target="_blank">Ensembl</a>
Regulatory Annotation of regional function and activity in each of 17 human cell types. The Ensembl
Regulatory Build provides a genome-wide set of regions that are likely to be involved in gene regulation.
These regions are classified into six functional types (see below).
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
This section describes track configuration controls, or any special display conventions such as the
meaning of different colors in your tracks. 
-->
<p>
The colours used for each of the functional classification follow the following segmentation standard:
</p>
<ul>
